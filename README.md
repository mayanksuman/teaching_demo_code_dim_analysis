# Example Code: Dimensional Analysis

This is additional material for the teaching presentation on dimensional analysis. The code provide examples for deriving non-dimensional numbers using the parameters involved in the phenomenon. Further, problem on Buckingham Pi theorem as discussed in the lecture is also soved here using symnolic algebra on parameters involved. 

The example code uses a modified version of `buckinghampy` library. For an explanation of the motivation, background, and implementation of the library, see
[this article](http://ian-r-rose.github.io/automated-dimensional-analysis.html). 

The example code need `jupyter` environment (`jupyter lab` or `jupyter notebook`) with python 3.8+. If you do not have proper jupyter environment set, the files can be run from [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mayanksuman/teaching_demo_code_dim_analysis/main?urlpath=lab/tree/dim_analysis.ipynb). PDF files for above code are also provided.

`requirements.txt` file list the python libraries required to run the above-listed code (provided jupyter environment is set up).

`apt.txt` file lists system depedencies required to run this code.
